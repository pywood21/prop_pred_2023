## Predicting mechanical properties of spruce wood in the transverse direction by using CNN

---

#### 1. Brief introduction

   The convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied in this study to automatically extract the anatomical features of wood for predicting their mechanical properties in the transverse direction. 

  And this repository aims to show the workflow for training regular CNN and density-informed CNN for predicting the modulus of elasticity of wood with different orientations of ray parenchyma cell (ORP).
