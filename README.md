## Predicting mechanical properties of spruce wood in the transverse direction by using deep learning-based approaches

---

#### 1. Aims

   The convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied in study to autotmatically extract the anatomical features of wood for predicting their mechanical properties in the transverse direction. 

  And this repository aims to show the workflow  for training regular CNN and density informed CNN for predicting modulus of elasticity of  wood.

#### 2. What is in this repository

   The repository contains the necessary codesfor building two CNN models for predicting the  mechanical properties of wood in the transverse direction. For the details please check the jupyter notebook:
